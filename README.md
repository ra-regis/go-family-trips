I'm happy to create online content.
Before the dot com boom, though, I simply jotted ideas on paper.
They were short stories I wrote on hot, boring summer afternoons when music videos from one-hit-wonders were just unbearable to watch on the MTV channel.
That was in the 90's.
Fast forward to the 2000s, I managed to build this passion into a lucrative career.
Then I became a mom and was the happiest woman alive.
Mommy duties demanded of me to kick my career in the backseat because that was the only best option.
I elude the mediocre, so I heeded.
My boy is growing up to be a kind, happy, and smart human being.
Mission accomplished.
While doing number 8, I also wanted to realize other plans.
"I want to go to graduate school."
So I did what a student adviser said was a crazy and bad idea nobody has done in the history of the UVA Graduate School of Communications.
I was nursing a baby, changing nappies, reading dozens of scientific articles a week, studying for exams, conducting social experiments.
I considered that a fulfilling time because I was on the road to accomplishing a personal project, notwithstanding the hurdles.
A year and a half later, I walked on stage to receive my diploma.
I thought, "Hey, I can do anything."
Now, I'm looking for meaningful work--a job that'd make me excited to get up everyday.
I love technology, not necessarily to develop it, but to write about it and raise awareness about the benefits these new innovations have to offer to big and small enterprises.
Hi, I'm Reina! And this is just the beginning of my technical writing journey.
